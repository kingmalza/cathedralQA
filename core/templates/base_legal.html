            Thanks for using Cathedral’s Cloud Products!  These Cathedral Cloud Terms of Service (these “Terms”) describe your rights and responsibilities as a customer of our Cloud Products.<br> As applicable to the specific Cloud Product, if you are being invited or added to a Cloud Product set up by an Cathedral customer, the User Notice governs your access and use of the Cloud Product (and not these Terms).<br>  These Terms are between you and the Cathedral entity that owns or operates the Cloud Product that you are using or accessing listed here (“Cathedral”, “we” or “us”).  “You” means the entity you represent in accepting these Terms or, if that does not apply, you individually.<br>  If you are accepting on behalf of your employer or another entity, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to these Terms; (ii) you have read and understand these Terms; and (iii) you agree to these Terms on behalf of the party that you represent.<br> If you don’t have the legal authority to bind your employer or the applicable entity please do not click “I agree” (or similar button or checkbox) that is presented to you.<br>  PLEASE NOTE THAT IF YOU SIGN UP FOR A CLOUD PRODUCT USING AN EMAIL ADDRESS FROM YOUR EMPLOYER OR ANOTHER ENTITY, THEN (A) YOU WILL BE DEEMED TO REPRESENT SUCH PARTY, (B) YOUR CLICK TO ACCEPT WILL BIND YOUR EMPLOYER OR THAT ENTITY TO THESE TERMS, AND (C) THE WORD “YOU” IN THESE TERMS WILL REFER TO YOUR EMPLOYER OR THAT ENTITY.<br>
These Terms are effective as of the date you first click “I agree” (or similar button or checkbox) or use or access a Cloud Product, whichever is earlier (the “Effective Date”).<br> These Terms do not have to be signed in order to be binding.<br> You indicate your assent to these Terms by clicking “I agree” (or similar button or checkbox) at the time you register for a Cloud Product, create a Cloud Product account, or place an Order.<br> For No-Charge Products, you also indicate your assent to these Terms by accessing or using the applicable No-Charge Product.<br>  
<br><br> 
1. What these Terms cover.
<br><br> 
1.1. Cloud Products. These Terms govern our Cloud Products, related Support, and Additional Services. These Terms include Our Policies (including our Privacy Policy), the Product-Specific Terms, and your Orders.
<br><br> 
1.2. Product-Specific Terms. Some Cloud Products may be subject to additional terms specific to that product as set forth in the Product-Specific Terms. By accessing or using a product covered by the Product-Specific Terms, you also agree to the Product-Specific Terms.
<br><br> 
1.3. Software Products Not Covered. These Terms do not apply to our downloadable software products (currently designated as “Server” and “Data Center” deployments), use of which requires a separate license agreement with us. For clarity, however, any client software (e.g., a desktop or mobile application) we provide as part of the Cloud Products themselves remains subject to these Terms.
<br><br> 
2. How Cloud Products are administered.
<br><br> 
2.1. Administrators. Through the Cloud Products, you may be able to specify certain End Users as Administrators, who will have important rights and controls over your use of Cloud Products and End User Accounts. This may include making Orders for Cloud Products or enabling Apps (which may incur fees); creating, de-provisioning, monitoring or modifying End User Accounts, and setting End User usage permissions; and managing access to Your Data by End Users or others. Administrators may also take over management of accounts previously registered using an email address belonging to your domain (which become “managed accounts”, as described in our Documentation). Without limiting Section 2.4 (Responsibility for End Users), which fully applies to Administrators, you are responsible for whom you allow to become Administrators and any actions they take, including as described above. You agree that our responsibilities do not extend to the internal management or administration of the Cloud Products for you.
<br><br> 
2.2. Reseller as Administrator. If you order Cloud Products through a Reseller, then you are responsible for determining whether the Reseller may serve as an Administrator and for any related rights or obligations in your applicable agreement with the Reseller.  As between you and Cathedral, you are solely responsible for any access by Reseller to your accounts or your other End User Accounts.
<br><br> 
2.3. End User Consent. You will provide all required disclosures to and will obtain and maintain all required consents from End Users to allow: (i) Administrators to have the access described in these Terms and the Privacy Policy; and (ii) Cathedral’s provision of the Cloud Products to Administrators and End Users. You will provide evidence of such consents upon our reasonable request. 
<br><br> 
2.4. Responsibility for End Users. Our Cloud Products have various user onboarding flows. Some Cloud Products require users to be designated by Administrators; some allow users to sign up for individual accounts which can become associated with teams or organizations at a later time; and some may allow users to invite other users. You are responsible for understanding the settings and controls for each Cloud Product you use and for controlling whom you allow to become an End User. If payment is required for End Users to use or access a Cloud Product, then we are only required to provide the Cloud Products to those End Users for whom you have paid the applicable fees, and only such End Users are permitted to access and use the Cloud Products. Some Cloud Products may allow you to designate different types of End Users, in which case pricing and functionality may vary according to the type of End User. You are responsible for compliance with these Terms by all End Users, including for any payment obligations. Please note that you are responsible for the activities of all your End Users, including Orders they may place and how End Users use Your Data, even if those End Users are not from your organization or domain. We may display our User Notice to End Users at sign up, account creation, Cloud Product registration, or in-product. If you use single sign-on (SSO) for identity management of your Cloud Product(s) such that End Users will bypass these screens and our User Notice, you are responsible for displaying our User Notice to End Users and for any damages resulting from your failure to do so.
<br><br> 
2.5. Credentials. You must require that all End Users keep their user IDs and passwords for the Cloud Products strictly confidential and do not share such information with any unauthorized person. User IDs are granted to individual, named persons and may not be shared. You are responsible for any and all actions taken using End User Accounts and passwords, and you agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of which you become aware.
<br><br> 
2.6. Age Requirement for End Users. The Cloud Products are not intended for, and should not be used by, anyone under the age of 18. You are responsible for ensuring that all End Users are at least 18 years old.
<br><br> 
2.7. Domain Name Ownership. Where you are required to specify a domain for the operation of a Cloud Product or certain Cloud Product features, we may verify that you own or control that domain. If you do not own or control the domain you specify, then we will have no obligation to provide you with the Cloud Product or Cloud Product features.
<br><br> 
3. What's included in your Cloud Product subscriptions; what are the restrictions.
<br><br> 
3.1. Access to Cloud Products. Subject to these Terms and during the applicable Subscription Term, you may access and use the Cloud Products for your own business purposes or personal use, as applicable, all in accordance with these Terms, the applicable Order and the Documentation. This includes the right, as part of your authorized use of the Cloud Products, to download (if it is downloadable) and use the client software associated with the Cloud Products. The rights granted to you in this Section 3.1 are non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable.
<br><br> 
3.2. Support. During the Subscription Term, we will provide Support for the Cloud Products in accordance with the Support Policy, Enterprise Support and Services Policy (to the extent applicable), and the applicable Order.
<br><br> 
3.3. Restrictions. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in these Terms, you will not: (a) reproduce, modify, adapt or create derivative works of the Cloud Products; (b) rent, lease, distribute, sell, sublicense, transfer or provide access to the Cloud Products to a third party; (c) use the Cloud Products for the benefit of any third party; (d) incorporate any Cloud Products into a product or service you provide to a third party; (e) interfere with or otherwise circumvent mechanisms in the Cloud Products intended to limit your use; (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats or non-public APIs to any Cloud Products, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law (and then only upon advance notice to us); (g) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in any Cloud Product; (h) use the Cloud Products for competitive analysis or to build competitive products; (i) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Cloud Products; or (j) encourage or assist any third party to do any of the foregoing.
<br><br> 
4. Our security and data privacy policies.
<br><br> 
4.1. Security. We implement security procedures designed to help protect Your Data from security attacks.
<br><br> 
4.2. Privacy. We collect certain data and information about you and your End Users in connection with your and your End Users’ use of the Cloud Products and otherwise in connection with these Terms. We collect and use all such data and information in accordance with our Privacy Policy, which you acknowledge.
<br><br> 
4.3. Improving Cloud Products. We are always striving to improve the Cloud Products. In order to do so, we use analytics techniques to better understand how our Cloud Products are being used. For more information on these techniques and the type of data collected, please read our Privacy Policy.
<br><br> 
4.4. Subpoenas. Nothing in these Terms prevents us from disclosing Your Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas or court orders, but we will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you where permitted to do so. Cathedral strives to balance your privacy rights with other legal requirements; to read more about Cathedral’s policies and guidelines for law enforcement officials requesting access to customer data, please see our Guidelines for Law Enforcement Requests.
<br><br> 
4.5. GDPR Data Processing Addendum. If you are in the EEAU, Switzerland, or are otherwise subject to the territorial scope of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) or any successor legislation, you can request and complete the Cathedral Data Processing Addendum here.
<br><br> 
5. Terms that apply to Your Data.
<br><br> 
5.1. Using Your Data to provide Cloud Products to You. You retain all right, title and interest in and to Your Data in the form submitted to the Cloud Products. Subject to these Terms, and solely to the extent necessary to provide the Cloud Products to you, you grant us a worldwide, limited term license to access, use, process, copy, distribute, perform, export, and display Your Data. Solely to the extent that reformatting Your Data for display in a Cloud Product constitutes a modification or derivative work, the foregoing license also includes the right to make modifications and derivative works. We may also access your accounts, End User Accounts, and your Cloud Products with End User permission in order to respond to your support requests.
<br><br> 
5.2. Your Data Compliance Obligations. You and your use of Cloud Products (including use by your End Users) must comply at all times with these Terms, the Acceptable Use Policy and all Laws. You represent and warrant that: (i) you have obtained all necessary rights, releases and permissions to submit all Your Data to the Cloud Products and to grant the rights granted to us in these Terms and (ii) Your Data and its submission and use as you authorize in these Terms will not violate (1) any Laws, (2) any third-party intellectual property, privacy, publicity or other rights, or (3) any of your or third-party policies or terms governing Your Data. Other than our express obligations under Section 4 (Our security and data privacy policies), we assume no responsibility or liability for Your Data, and you are solely responsible for Your Data and the consequences of submitting and using it with the Cloud Products.
<br><br> 
5.3. No Sensitive Data. You will not submit to the Cloud Products (or use the Cloud Products to collect) any Sensitive Data. You also acknowledge that we are not acting as your Business Associate or subcontractor (as such terms are defined and used in HIPAA). The Cloud Products are neither HIPAA nor PCI DSS compliant. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, we have no liability under these Terms for Sensitive Data.
<br><br> 
5.4. Your Indemnity. You will defend, indemnify and hold harmless us (and our Affiliates, officers, directors, agents and employees) from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) resulting from any claim arising from or related to (i) your breach of Section 2.3 (End User Consent) or any claims or disputes brought by your End Users arising out of their use of Cloud Products, (ii) your breach (or alleged breach) of Sections 5.2 (Your Data Compliance Obligations) or 5.3 (No Sensitive Data); or (iii) Your Materials. This indemnification obligation is subject to you receiving (a) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for you to respond without prejudice); (b) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense or settlement of such claim and (c) all reasonable necessary cooperation by us at your expense.
<br><br> 
5.5. Removals and Suspension. We have no obligation to monitor any content uploaded to the Cloud Products. Nonetheless, if we deem such action necessary based on your violation of these Terms, including Our Policies, or in response to takedown requests that we receive following our guidelines for Reporting Copyright and Trademark Violations, we may (1) remove Your Data from the Cloud Products or (2) suspend your access to the Cloud Products. We will use reasonable efforts to provide you with advance notice of removals and suspensions when practicable, but if we determine that your actions endanger the operation of the Cloud Product or other users, we may suspend your access or remove Your Data immediately without notice. We have no liability to you for removing or deleting Your Data from or suspending your access to any Cloud Products as described in this Section 5.5.
<br><br> 
6. Using third-party products with the Cloud Products.
<br><br> 
6.1. Third-Party Products. You (including your End Users) may choose to use or procure other third party products or services in connection with the Cloud Products, including Third Party Apps (see Section 6.2 (Marketplace Apps)) or implementation, customization, training or other services provide by your uploaded code (Example is Aida personal libraries upload). Your receipt or use of any third party products or services (and the third parties’ use of any of Your Data) is subject to a separate agreement between you and the third party provider. If you enable or use third party products or services with the Cloud Products we will allow the third party providers to access or use Your Data as required for the interoperation of their products and services with the Cloud Products. This may include transmitting, transferring, modifying or deleting Your Data, or storing Your Data on systems belonging to the third party providers or other third parties. Any third party provider’s use of Your Data is subject to the applicable agreement between you and such third party provider. We are not responsible for any access to or use of Your Data by third party providers or their products or services, or for the security or privacy practices of any third party provider or its products or services. You are solely responsible for your decision to permit any third party provider or third party product or service to use Your Data. It is your responsibility to carefully review the agreement between you and the third party provider, as provided by the applicable third party provider. WE DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES (WHETHER SUPPORT, AVAILABILITY, SECURITY OR OTHERWISE) OR FOR THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF ANY THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS OR VENDORS. 
<br><br> 
7. Using Cathedral developer assets. Access to any of our APIs, SDKs or other Cathedral developer assets is subject to the Cathedral Developer Terms, which is a separate agreement.
<br><br> 
8. Additional Services.
<br><br> 
8.1. Additional Services. Subject to these Terms, you may purchase Additional Services that we will provide to you pursuant to the applicable Order. Additional Services may be subject to additional policies and terms as specified by us, including the Enterprise Support and Services Policy.
<br><br> 
8.2. Our Deliverables. We will retain all right, title and interest in and to Our Deliverables. You may use any of Our Deliverables provided to you only in connection with the Cloud Products, subject to the same usage rights and restrictions as for the Cloud Products. For clarity, Our Deliverables are not considered Cloud Products, and any Cloud Products are not considered to be Our Deliverables.
<br><br> 
8.3. Your Materials. You agree to provide us with reasonable access to Your Materials as reasonably necessary for our provision of Additional Services. If you do not provide us with timely access to Your Materials, our performance of Additional Services will be excused until you do so. You retain your rights in Your Materials, subject to our ownership of any Cloud Products, any of Our Deliverables or any of Our Technology underlying Your Materials. We will use Your Materials solely for purposes of performing the Additional Services. You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights in Your Materials to provide them to us for such purposes.
<br><br> 
8.4. Training Not Covered. Your purchase, and our provision, of Training is subject to our Training Terms and Policies, which is a separate agreement.
<br><br> 
9. Billing, renewals, and payment.
<br><br> 
9.1. Monthly and OnDemand. Except for No-Charge Products, all Cloud Products are offered either on a monthly subscription basis or an ondemand subscription basis.
<br><br> 
9.2. Renewals. Except as otherwise specified in your Order, unless either party cancels your subscription prior to expiration of the current Subscription Term, your subscription will automatically renew for another Subscription Term of a period equal to your initial Subscription Term. You will provide any notice of non-renewal through the means we designate, which may include account settings in the Cloud Products or contacting our support team. Cancelling your subscription means that you will not be charged for the next billing cycle, but you will not receive any refunds or credits for amounts that have already been charged. All renewals are subject to the applicable Cloud Product continuing to be offered and will be charged at the then-current rates.
<br><br> 
9.3. Adding Users. You may add users, increase storage limits, or otherwise increase your use of Cloud Products by placing a new Order or modifying an existing Order. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Order, we will charge you for any increased use at our then-current rates, prorated for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term.
<br><br> 
9.4. Payment. You will pay all fees in accordance with each Order, by the due dates and in the currency specified in the Order. If a PO number is required in order for an invoice to be paid, then you must provide such PO number to Cathedral by emailing the PO number to wepredict@cathedral.ai. For Additional Services provided at any non-Cathedral location, unless otherwise specified in your Order, you will reimburse us for our pre-approved travel, lodging and meal expenses, which we may charge as incurred. Other than as expressly set forth in Section 10 (Our return policy), 18.3 (Warranty Remedy), Section 20 (IP Indemnification) or Section 24 (Changes to these Terms), all amounts are non-refundable, non-cancelable and non-creditable. You agree that we may bill your credit card or other payment method for renewals, additional users, overages to set limits or scopes of use, expenses, and unpaid fees, as applicable.
<br><br> 
9.5. Delivery. We will deliver the login instructions for Cloud Products to your account or through other reasonable means no later than when we have received payment of the applicable fees. You are responsible for accessing your account to determine that we have received payment and that your Order has been processed. All deliveries under these Terms will be electronic.
<br><br> 
10. Our return policy. As part of our commitment to customer satisfaction and without limiting the Performance Warranty in Section 18 (Warranties and Disclaimer), you may terminate your initial Order of a Cloud Product under these Terms, for no reason or any reason, by providing notice of termination to us no later than thirty (30) days after the Order date for such Cloud Product. In the event you terminate your initial Order under this Section 10, at your request (which may be made through your account with us), we will refund you the amount paid under such Order. This termination and refund right applies only to your initial Order of the Cloud Product and only if you exercise your termination right within the period specified above, and does not apply to Additional Services. You understand that we may change this practice in the future in accordance with Section 24 (Changes to these Terms).
<br><br> 
11. Taxes not included.
<br><br> 
11.1. Taxes. Your fees under these Terms exclude any taxes or duties payable in respect of the Cloud Products in the jurisdiction where the payment is either made or received. To the extent that any such taxes or duties are payable by us, you must pay to us the amount of such taxes or duties in addition to any fees owed under these Terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have obtained an exemption from relevant taxes or duties as of the time such taxes or duties are levied or assessed, you may provide us with such exemption information, and we will use reasonable efforts to provide you with invoicing documents designed to enable you to obtain a refund or credit from the relevant revenue authority, if such a refund or credit is available.
<br><br> 
11.2. Withholding Taxes. You will pay all fees net of any applicable withholding taxes. You and we will work together to avoid any withholding tax if exemptions, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, are available. If we qualify for a tax exemption, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, we will provide you with reasonable documentary proof. You will provide us reasonable evidence that you have paid the relevant authority for the sum withheld or deducted.
<br><br> 
12. If you purchased through a Reseller. If you make any purchases through an authorized partner or reseller of Cathedral (“Reseller”):
(a) Instead of paying us, you will pay the applicable amounts to the Reseller, as agreed between you and the Reseller. We may suspend or terminate your rights to use Cloud Products if we do not receive the corresponding payment from the Reseller.
(b) Your order details (e.g., the Cloud Products you are entitled to use, the number of End Users, the Subscription Term, etc.) will be as stated in the Order placed with us by the Reseller on your behalf, and Reseller is responsible for the accuracy of any such Order as communicated to us.
(c) If you are entitled to a refund under these Terms, then unless we otherwise specify, we will refund any applicable fees to the Reseller and the Reseller will be solely responsible for refunding the appropriate amounts to you.
(d) Resellers are not authorized to modify these Terms or make any promises or commitments on our behalf, and we are not bound by any obligations to you other than as set forth in these Terms.
<br><br> 
13. No contingencies on other products of future functionality. You acknowledge that the Cloud Products and Additional Services referenced in an Order are being purchased separately from any of our other products or services. Payment obligations for any products or services are not contingent on the purchase or use of any of our other products (and for clarity, any purchases of Cloud Products and Additional Services are separate and not contingent on each other, even if listed on the same Order). You agree that your purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features (including future availability of any Cloud Products beyond the current Subscription Term), or dependent on any oral or written public comments we make regarding future functionality or features.
<br><br> 
14. Evaluations, trials, and betas. We may offer certain Cloud Products (including some Cathedral Apps) to you at no charge, including free accounts, trial use and Beta Versions as defined below (collectively, “No-Charge Products”). Your use of No-Charge Products is subject to any additional terms that we specify and is only permitted during the Subscription Term we designate (or, if not designated, until terminated in accordance with these Terms). Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 14, the terms and conditions of these Terms governing Cloud Products, including Section 3.3 (Restrictions), fully apply to No-Charge Products. We may modify or terminate your right to use No-Charge Products at any time and for any reason in our sole discretion, without liability to you. You understand that any pre-release and beta Cloud Products, and any pre-release and beta features within generally available Cloud Products, that we make available (collectively, “Beta Versions”) are still under development, may be inoperable or incomplete and are likely to contain more errors and bugs than generally available Cloud Products. We make no promises that any Beta Versions will ever be made generally available. In some circumstances, we may charge a fee in order to allow you to access Beta Versions, but the Beta Versions will still remain subject to this Section 14. All information regarding the characteristics, features or performance of any No-Charge Products (including Beta Versions) constitutes our Confidential Information. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all obligations or liabilities with respect to No-Charge Products, including any Support, warranty and indemnity obligations. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THESE TERMS, OUR MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU IN RESPECT OF NO-CHARGE PRODUCTS WILL BE EUR€100.
<br><br> 
15. IP Rights in the Cloud Products and Feedback. Cloud Products are made available on a limited access basis, and no ownership right is conveyed to you, irrespective of the use of terms such as “purchase” or “sale”. We and our licensors have and retain all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to Our Technology (including the Cloud Products). From time to time, you may choose to submit Feedback to us. We may in connection with any of our products or services freely use, copy, disclose, license, distribute and exploit any Feedback in any manner without any obligation, royalty or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. No Feedback will be considered your Confidential Information, and nothing in these Terms limits our right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products or services, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.
<br><br> 
16. Confidentiality. Except as otherwise set forth in these Terms, each party agrees that all code, inventions, know-how and business, technical and financial information disclosed to such party (“Receiving Party”) by the disclosing party ("Disclosing Party") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (“Confidential Information”), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure. Any of Our Technology and any performance information relating to the Cloud Products will be deemed our Confidential Information without any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under these Terms. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know, provided that they are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 16 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by them with the terms of this Section 16. The Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations will not apply to information which the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information. The Receiving Party may also disclose Confidential Information if so required pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing Party). The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.
<br><br> 
17. Term and Termination.
<br><br> 
17.1. Term. These Terms are effective as of the Effective Date and expire on the date of expiration or termination of all Subscription Terms.
<br><br> 
17.2. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate these Terms (including all related Orders) if the other party (a) fails to cure any material breach of these Terms within thirty (30) days after notice; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter).
<br><br> 
17.3. Termination for Convenience. You may choose to stop using the Cloud Products and terminate these Terms (including all Orders) at any time for any reason upon written notice to us, but, unless you are exercising your right to terminate early pursuant to Section 10 (Our return policy), upon any such termination (i) you will not be entitled to a refund of any pre-paid fees and (ii) if you have not already paid all applicable fees for the then-current Subscription Term or related services period (as applicable), any such fees that are outstanding will become immediately due and payable.
<br><br> 
17.4. Effects of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of these Terms, you must cease using all Cloud Products and delete (or at our request, return) all Confidential Information or other materials of ours in your possession, including on any third-party systems operated on your behalf. You will certify such deletion upon our request. You will not have access to Your Data (and we may delete all of Your Data unless legally prohibited) after expiration or termination of these Terms (or its applicable Subscription Term), so you should make sure to export Your Data using the functionality of the Cloud Products (if any) during the applicable Subscription Term.

If we terminate these Terms in accordance with Section 17.2 (Termination for Cause), you will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term after the effective date of termination. In no event will termination relieve you of your obligation to pay any fees payable to us for the period prior to the effective date of termination.

In this case, you will receive a refund of any fees you have pre-paid for use of the Cloud Product for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term. The Performance Warranty will not apply: (i) unless you make a claim within thirty (30) days of the date on which you first noticed the non-conformity, (ii) if the non-conformity was caused by misuse, unauthorized modifications or third-party products, software, services or equipment or (iii) to No-Charge Products.

YOU UNDERSTAND THAT USE OF THE CLOUD PRODUCTS NECESSARILY INVOLVES TRANSMISSION OF YOUR DATA OVER NETWORKS THAT WE DO NOT OWN, OPERATE OR CONTROL, AND WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF YOUR DATA LOST, ALTERED, INTERCEPTED OR STORED ACROSS SUCH NETWORKS. WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT OUR SECURITY PROCEDURES WILL BE ERROR-FREE, THAT TRANSMISSIONS OF YOUR DATA WILL ALWAYS BE SECURE OR THAT UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTIES WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DEFEAT OUR SECURITY MEASURES OR THOSE OF OUR THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, SERVICE FAILURES OR OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER SYSTEMS OUTSIDE OUR REASONABLE CONTROL. YOU MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, BUT THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, WILL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.

<br><br> 
20. IP Indemnification. We will defend you against any claim brought against you by a third party alleging that the Cloud Products, when used as authorized under these Terms, infringe a patent right granted in the United States, Australia or a member nation of the European Union or a copyright registered in such a jurisdiction (a “Claim”), and we will indemnify you and hold you harmless against any damages and costs finally awarded on the Claim by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to via settlement executed by us (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), provided that we have received from you: (a) prompt written notice of the Claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for us to respond without prejudice); (b) reasonable assistance in the defense and investigation of the Claim, including providing us a copy of the Claim, all relevant evidence in your possession, custody, or control, and cooperation with evidentiary discovery, litigation, and trial, including making witnesses within your employ or control available for testimony; and (c) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, and settlement (if applicable) of the Claim. If your use of the Cloud Products is (or in your opinion is likely to be) enjoined, whether by court order or by settlement, or if we determine such actions are reasonably necessary to avoid material liability, we may, at our option and in our discretion: (i) procure the right for your continued use of the Cloud Product in accordance with these Terms; (ii) substitute a substantially functionally similar Cloud Product; or (iii) terminate your right to continue using the Cloud Product and refund any prepaid amounts for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term. Our indemnification obligations above do not apply: (1) if the total aggregate fees we receive with respect to your subscription to a Cloud Product in the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the Claim is less than EUR€50,000; (2) if the Cloud Product is modified by any party other than us, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification; (3) if the Cloud Product is used in combination with any non-Cathedral product, software, service or equipment, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination; (4) to unauthorized use of Cloud Products; (5) to any Claim arising as a result of (y) Your Data or circumstances covered by your indemnification obligations in Section 5.4 (Your Indemnity) or (z) any third-party deliverables or components contained with the Cloud Products or (6) if you settle or make any admissions with respect to a Claim without our prior written consent. THIS SECTION 20 (IP INDEMNIFICATION) STATES OUR SOLE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLOUD PRODUCT OR OTHER ITEMS WE PROVIDE UNDER THESE TERMS.

In any action or proceeding to enforce a party’s rights under these Terms, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees.
<br><br> 
22.3. Injunctive Relief; Enforcement. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 22.1 (Informal Resolution) and 22.2 (Governing Law; Jurisdiction), nothing in these Terms will prevent us from seeking injunctive relief with respect to a violation of intellectual property rights, confidentiality obligations or enforcement or recognition of any award or order in any appropriate jurisdiction.

        Here at Cathedral, our goal is to help you and your team do the best work of your lives, every day. To do this, we need to keep our products and services running smoothly, quickly, and without distraction. For this to happen, we need help from you, our users. We need you not to misuse or abuse our products and services.
        <br>
To describe exactly what we mean by “misuse” or “abuse” – and help us identify such transgressions, and react accordingly – we’ve created this Acceptable Use Policy. Under this policy, we reserve the right to remove content that is inconsistent with the spirit of the guidelines, even if it’s something that is not forbidden by the letter of the policy. In other words, if you do something that isn’t listed here verbatim, but it looks or smells like something listed here, we may still remove it.
You’ll see the word “services” a lot throughout this page. That refers to all websites owned or operated by Cathedral, and any related websites, sub-domains and pages, as well as any cloud services operated by Cathedral.
<br>
Use your judgment, and let’s be kind to each other so we can keep creating great things. You can find all the legal fine print at the bottom of this page.
<br>
Here’s what we won’t allow:
<br><br>
Disruption

<br>

<br>
•	Modifying, disabling, or compromising the integrity or performance of the services or related systems, network or data
<br>
•	Deciphering any transmissions to or from the servers running the services
<br>

<br>
•	Using “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers,” or other automated systems to sends more request messages to our servers than a human could reasonably send in the same period of time by using a normal browser
<br>
•	Going far beyond the use parameters for any given service as described in its corresponding documentation
<br>
•	Consuming an unreasonable amount of storage for music, videos, pornography, etc., in a way that’s unrelated to the purposes for which the services were designed
<br><br>
Wrongful activities

<br>

<br>
•	Using meta tags or any other “hidden text” including Cathedral’s or our suppliers’ product names or trademarks
<br><br>
Inappropriate communications
<br>

<br><br> 
Inappropriate content
<br>

<br>
•	Infringes Cathedral’s or a third party’s intellectual property or other rights, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral rights, privacy rights of publicity, or any other intellectual property right or proprietary or contractual right
<br>
•	You don’t have the right to submit
<br>

        <h3 class="box-title"><strong>Enterprise Support and Services Policy</strong></h3>
        <br>
        Effective starting: November 1, 2018
        </div><!-- /.box-header -->
        <div class="box-body">
        This Enterprise Support and Services Policy (the “Policy”) governs Cathedral’s provision of certain Additional Services and Training Credits in connection with its software and cloud offerings (“Cathedral Products”).  This Policy supplements the Cathedral Cloud Terms of Service (each, the “Agreement”) and will control in event of a conflict with the Agreement relating to Additional Services.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 3 (Training Credits) specifies additional terms that govern our provision of Courses and Training Credits (defined below).<br>Capitalized terms not defined in this Policy have the same meanings given to them in the Agreement, and “you” means the person or entity with a license or subscription to Cathedral Products as defined in the Agreement.
        <br><br>
1.   Enterprise Support. If Enterprise Support services are included in the applicable Order, the following terms will also apply:
<br>
      1.1 Description of Enterprise Support Services. “Enterprise Support” refers to Cathedral’s Premier Support and Priority Support services. The description of the applicable Enterprise Support service, how it works, target Response Times, and coverage is located in the “Offering Details” for such service, which are located here for Premier Support services and here for Priority Support services.  Enterprise Support services are performed remotely via phone, screen shares, tickets, chat and other electronic means and will not include travel to or time spent on your site.  Enterprise Support does not include any software or software upgrades.  For the avoidance of doubt, services not included in the Offering Details are not Enterprise Support services.  The Offering Details and features are subject to change in accordance with the process set forth for changes to our policies in the Agreement.
      <br>
      1.2 Requirement to be Current in Maintenance. Enterprise Support requests are limited to Cathedral Products that are covered under current and up-to-date maintenance periods.  If you request Enterprise Support coverage on an Cathedral Product that does not have a current and up-to-date maintenance period, then the request is excluded from the Enterprise Support offering until you bring your maintenance current.
      <br>
      1.3 Support Period. The Support Period will be indicated in your Order and will expire on the date indicated in your my.Cathedral.com account.  Upon expiration of the Support Period, you will no longer have access to Enterprise Support.  The Support Period may be renewed by mutual written agreement of the parties, but terms and conditions, including pricing, are subject to change.
      <br>
      1.4 Onboarding Period. During an initial period after purchase, we will manually transition eligible tickets, calls, and support requests from standard support queues to the Enterprise Support queues until we configure the Required Information (as defined below) associated with your Enterprise Support account (the “Onboarding Period”).  During the Onboarding Period we will make reasonable efforts to meet the Response Times specified in the Offering Details.  We will continue to manually transition eligible support requests until we receive the Required Information from you and we configure it in our support systems.  “Required Information” means (i) in the case of Premier Support, named contacts and domains; or (ii) in the case of Priority Support, SEN numbers.
      <br>
      1.5 Publicity. Upon mutual written agreement of the parties, you agree to be featured as the subject of a case study testimonial or white paper written by us as described in this Section 1.5.  The testimonial or white paper will discuss your experience with Enterprise Support and may be published on our website, distributed in our marketing materials, or published in relevant media outlets.  You will have the right to approve such materials in advance, such approval not to be unreasonably delayed or withheld.
      <br><br>
2.   TAM Services. If TAM Services are included in the applicable Order, the following terms will also apply:
<br>
      2.1 Description of TAM Services.
      <br>
           (a) How the TAM program works. A Technical Account Manager (“TAM”) is an Cathedral product specialist who serves as your key point of contact with us and who provides general advice and guidance on Cathedral Products and related services (as further specified below). We will designate an individual to serve as your TAM. We may designate a new TAM for you from time to time, upon notice to you. The TAM will be available to provide Cathedral TAM support services as further described below (“TAM Services”) to you during Business Hours (as defined below) for up to eight (8) hours a week during the TAM Services term (inclusive of direct support interactions and internal efforts on your behalf). TAM Services may be provided via e-mail or over the phone, as designated by us and on the schedule mutually agreed by the TAM and your Account Representatives. From time to time as set forth in the Datasheet (as defined below), or as otherwise may be requested by you and at your expense, the TAM may travel to your site for the purposes of attending business meetings. However, for the avoidance of doubt, the TAM will not render any TAM Services at your location at any time. “Business Hours” means 9am to 5pm in a mutually agreed primary location for service delivery on any day the New York Stock Exchange is open.
           <br>
           (b) Account Representatives. You will designate up to two (2) individuals to serve as key points of contact with the TAM (the “Account Representatives”). You will submit all your requests through your Account Representatives, and we will rely and act upon each Account Representative’s instructions. You will ensure that your Account Representatives have baseline technical knowledge of the Cathedral Products.
           <br>
           (c) Requirement to be Current in Maintenance. TAM Services are limited to Cathedral Products that are covered under current and up-to-date maintenance periods. If you request TAM Services coverage on an Cathedral Product that does not have a current and up-to-date maintenance period, then the request is excluded from the TAM Services offering until you bring your maintenance current.
           <br>
           (d) What the TAM does. A full description of the TAM Service delivery is available in the TAM Services Datasheet (“Datasheet”). Actual areas of advice and guidance will depend on your requests and needs. We may update the list of TAM Services from time to time upon notice to you. Topics not listed in the Datasheet are outside the scope of TAM Services.
           <br>
           (b) What the TAM does not do. The TAM will not:
           <br>
•	Be responsible for implementing your projects;
<br>
•	Provide any guaranteed influence on our roadmap; or
<br>
•	Provide customizations or modifications to the Cathedral Products.
      2.2 Limits on TAM Services. You acknowledge that the TAM Services fee is to secure the availability of the TAM as well as the time and effort spent by the TAM on TAM Services.  Hours not consumed in a given week cannot be banked, accumulated or saved for subsequent weeks. While we will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide TAM Services in a professional manner and to address your requests, we do not guarantee that we will resolve all requests.
      2.3 TAM Services Term. The TAM Services Term shall all be indicated in your Order.  The TAM Services Term starts on the TAM Services start date indicated in your Order.  Upon expiration of the TAM Services Term, you will no longer have access to the TAM Services.  The TAM Services Term may be renewed by mutual written agreement of the parties, but terms and conditions, including pricing, are subject to change.
      2.4 Publicity. Upon mutual written agreement of the parties, you agree to be featured as the subject of a case study testimonial or white paper written by us as described in this Section 2.4. The testimonial or white paper will discuss your experience with the TAM Services and may be published on our website, distributed in our marketing materials, or published in relevant media outlets. You will have the right to approve such materials in advance, such approval not to be unreasonably delayed or withheld.
      <br><br>
3.   Training Credits. If Training Credits are included in the applicable Order, the following terms will also apply.  “Training Credits” are prepaid funds of the dollar amount shown on the quote referenced in the applicable Order, to be applied against your purchase of Cathedral-sold training and certification programs (“Courses”) as detailed on https://training.Cathedral.ai/ during the Eligibility Period (defined below). Courses and Training Credits are subject to Cathedral’s Training Terms and Policies (“Training Terms and Policies”), subject to the terms below.  In the event of a conflict or any inconsistency between the applicable Order and the Training Terms and Policies, the Order will control.  For clarity, Courses and Training Credits are not subject to the Agreement.  To redeem Training Credits, you must make your purchase through our designated order flow and consume Courses through our designated platform in accordance with each Course’s availability timetable. Training Credits may not be applied against other purchases and cannot be combined with cash to purchase Courses. You are responsible for managing your training accounts and for any redemptions made using your accounts. Training Credits are applied against our standard training fees at the time of purchase of the Courses. Training Credits expire twelve (12) months from the Order effective date (“Eligibility Period”), regardless of the actual purchase date.  Unused Training Credits, including Training Credits that are redeemed but unconsumed, do not roll over and are non-transferable, non-creditable and non-refundable. You may purchase additional Training Credits to be used during the Eligibility Period, as mutually agreed in a subsequent Order.
