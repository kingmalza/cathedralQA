Repo for the open source Test Suite Cathedral project

Aida ATM (Automa-on Test Suite) allows you to
independently create, manage, plan and execute any type
of test on any type of soNware / firmware, a fundamental
characterisBc for every company in every industrial sector.
Aida is based on a roboframework and selenium plaTorm, it
uses a fast and intuiBve graphic interface for the creaBon of
its own test models and allows the importaBon of any
custom clilent libraries inside the suite.

# Installation

For the srver installation follow these details:
